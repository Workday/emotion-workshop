# Dealing with my Emotion, a CSS in JS Workshop

> In this workshop, you’ll learn the ins and outs of writing CSS in JS! We’ll take a React-based app with classic stylesheets, and step-by-step, migrate to CSS in JS using Emotion. We’ll cover both the benefits and the trade-offs of managing styles in JavaScript. Not only will you learn all the ways to leverage Emotion, you will become a Style Master!

This workshop was prepared for [DinosaurJS 2019](https://dinosaurjs.org/), but feel free to follow along on your own! You're also welcome to fork this repo and share it freely with others ♥.

2. Fun

3. Mastery of Emotion

### You should already know...

- JavaScript
- a little bit about component-oriented design in the frontend
- _basic_ CSS - nothing expert-level

### You will learn...

- Emotion!
- why CSS in JS is ready for mainstream development
- how to convert traditional stylesheets to CSS in JS
- general concepts for CSS in JS that apply to _any_ alternative, like [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/).
- more CSS than you already know (probably)

### Along the way, you will pickup...

- greater comfort with component composition in general
- React best practices
- nothing but function components powered by Hooks
- some awesome pro tips
- a love of no semi-colons

We _love_ questions, so please be brave and speak up! We'll do our best to create question asking opportunities. If you have trouble with wording your question, flag one of the instructors or teaching assistants and we'll help!

## How this workshop is organized

This workshop has several chapters, and each chapter follows a predictable pattern.

1. Introduce a new concept
2. Identify relevant documentation and starting points
3. Build stuff - on your own, at first
4. A guided walkthrough
5. Talk about it

Each chapter has a useful branch to checkout that has relevant comments and newly created files ready to go. Example: `01-styled-components`

Each chapter also has a useful branch to checkout that has the finished solution. Example: `01-styled-components-solution`

You can view all of these branches in the [Pull Request list](https://github.com/Workday/emotion-workshop/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acreated-asc)

## Getting started

In the project directory, install dependencies first:

`npm install`

Then you can run the app:

`npm start`

This starts an amazing Todo app in dev mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Editor Recommendations

We're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for this workshop. This is completely optional, so use whatever you prefer.

For syntax highlighting and IntelliSense we recommend the [vscode-styled-components extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jpoissonnier.vscode-styled-components).

[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) is configured, but completely optional.

## One more note before we begin

We don't assume everyone here knows CSS in and out (selectors, properties, etc), or even the latest JavaScript or React syntax (like hooks). We won't walk through every detail as we introduce concepts, but please do your best to focus on the _concepts_ we introduce. When we start each chapter's exercise (your time to code), please raise your hand right away and we'd love to iron out these details!!

Stuff like hooks is almost entirely in the background and we won't be touching these aspects directly!

On that note, here are a few links that may come up!

- [React Function Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components)
- [React State Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)

We also encourage pairing up, or at least offering/asking your neighbor for help and collaborating as much as possible.
