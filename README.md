# Dealing with my Emotion, a CSS in JS Workshop

> In this workshop, you’ll learn the ins and outs of writing CSS in JS! We’ll take a React-based app with classic stylesheets, and step-by-step, migrate to CSS in JS using Emotion. We’ll cover both the benefits and the trade-offs of managing styles in JavaScript. Not only will you learn all the ways to leverage Emotion, you will become a Style Master!

This workshop was prepared for [DinosaurJS 2019](https://dinosaurjs.org/), but feel free to follow along on your own! You're also welcome to fork this repo and share it freely with others ♥.
